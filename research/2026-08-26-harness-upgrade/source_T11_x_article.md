## Source-quality defect found in the text itself

The published article contains **four separate instances of leftover
authoring-prompt residue**, copied into the final text verbatim:

> "Here's a rewritten version with the same meaning, similar length, and a

(and three near-identical variants at Stage 1, Stage 2, and the summary
section). Stage 1's heading is also duplicated — it appears as
"Stage 1: Data — Where Every AI Model Begins" and then immediately again as
"Stage 1: Data — The Building Blocks of Every LLM".

What this proves, mechanically: the article was produced by asking a model to
paraphrase an existing article "to reduce similarity", and the model's own
preamble was never stripped before publishing. The author did not read their
own output end to end.

The five-stage pipeline it describes is real and standard; this article is
not the authority for it. Every claim used downstream is re-sourced to

value to this run is (a) it correctly names the five stages, which is a
usable teaching skeleton, and (b) it is a live specimen of the exact failure
mode the operator's F8 complaint is about.

How to Build Your Own LLM: The 5-Step Pipeline Behind GPT & Claude ⭐

Here's a rewritten version with the same meaning, similar length, and a fresh writing style to reduce similarity.

Millions of people use ChatGPT and Claude every day without ever understanding what actually makes them work.

Save this. 👇

A small number of people understand the complete process that transforms raw internet data into an AI model capable of writing, reasoning, and generating code. Once you understand that process, these models stop feeling like magic. You begin to see the engineering behind every response, and it completely changes the way you use them.

The gap between those who understand AI and those who simply use it isn't a PhD in mathematics.

It's having the right mental model.

Here's what most explanations miss: every modern frontier model—whether it's GPT, Claude, or another leading LLM—is built using the same fundamental five-stage pipeline. Each company has its own datasets, infrastructure, and engineering optimizations, but the overall workflow remains remarkably consistent. Learn that workflow once, and you'll understand the foundation behind every major language model.

Before we dive in, let's set one expectation. You're not going to build something comparable to GPT or Claude on your laptop. Training frontier models requires enormous engineering teams and tens of millions of dollars in compute. But that's not the objective. The real goal is to understand the pipeline deeply enough that you could recreate a small-scale version yourself, reason about why large models behave the way they do, and replace mystery with understanding. That knowledge is far more valuable than most people realize—and it's something anyone can learn.

Let's walk through the five stages, in the exact order they happen.

Stage 1: Data — Where Every AI Model Begins

Here's a rewritten version with the same meaning, similar length, and a fresh writing style.

Stage 1: Data — The Building Blocks of Every LLM

Every AI model starts with one thing: data. And not just a little—an enormous amount of it.

The first stage is all about collecting and preparing the information the model will learn from. For frontier models like GPT and Claude, that means pulling together vast amounts of text from sources such as public websites, books, research papers, code repositories, and many other datasets. But gathering the data is only half the challenge. The real work is making sure it's clean enough to learn from.

Raw data is full of noise. Duplicate content is removed because seeing the same paragraph thousands of times would bias the model's learning. Spam, low-quality text, and harmful material are filtered out, leaving behind higher-quality examples. This cleaning process is one of the most important steps in the entire pipeline. The principle is simple: garbage in, garbage out. A model trained on cleaner, more reliable data will almost always outperform one trained on a larger but messier dataset. In modern AI, data quality often matters more than data volume.

Next comes a concept that surprises many beginners: tokenization.

Language models don't read words or letters the way humans do. Instead, they split text into smaller units called tokens, which are often pieces of words rather than complete words. Even the word "tokenization" can be broken into multiple tokens. Before training begins, every document is converted into these numerical tokens. From that moment onward, the model never actually sees letters or words—it only processes sequences of numbers representing those tokens. That's one reason LLMs sometimes struggle with tasks like counting letters in a word: they were trained on tokens, not individual characters.

By the end of this stage, nothing has been learned yet. You simply have a massive, carefully cleaned, and fully tokenized dataset that's ready for training. Think of it as preparing all the ingredients before you start cooking.

How to Learn This Stage

Experiment with an online tokenizer to see how ordinary text is split into tokens.
Practice cleaning a small text dataset by removing duplicates, filtering noisy content, and standardizing formatting.
Compare how models perform when trained on clean versus messy datasets to understand why quality beats quantity.
Read engineering blogs from leading AI labs and notice how much effort goes into collecting, filtering, and preparing training data before any model training even begins.

Here's a rewritten version with the same meaning, similar length, and a more original writing style.

Stage 2: Pretraining — Where the Model Learns Everything It Can

This is the most computationally expensive stage of the entire pipeline—and it's where the model acquires nearly all of its knowledge.

At its core, pretraining revolves around one surprisingly simple objective: predict the next token.

The model is given a sequence of tokens and asked to guess which token comes next. It makes a prediction, compares it with the correct answer, slightly adjusts its internal parameters to improve, and then repeats the process. Again and again. Across trillions of tokens and billions of parameters.

That's the entire learning objective.

Predict the next token at massive scale.

What's remarkable is what emerges from such a simple task. To consistently predict the next token across books, websites, research papers, and code, the model has to absorb grammar, facts, reasoning patterns, programming syntax, and even the structure of human arguments. Nobody explicitly teaches it English grammar or Python syntax. It discovers those patterns naturally because understanding them improves its predictions.

Once this stage is complete, you end up with what's known as a base model.

A base model is incredibly knowledgeable, but it isn't designed to be an assistant. If you ask it a question, it may continue your sentence, imitate similar text, or produce something that merely sounds like a continuation. That's because its only objective has been to predict what comes next—not to be helpful, accurate, or conversational. It possesses enormous knowledge but no understanding of the role it's supposed to play.

This stage is arguably the most important concept to understand in the entire LLM pipeline. Once you realize that modern language models are fundamentally large-scale next-token prediction engines, many of their strengths and weaknesses suddenly make sense. Their fluency comes from predicting plausible continuations. Their hallucinations happen for the same reason—they're optimized to generate likely text, not guaranteed truth. Reliability and alignment are introduced in the stages that follow.

How to Learn This Stage

Make sure you can explain next-token prediction in one simple sentence without using technical jargon.
Train a tiny language model on a small dataset to experience the training loop firsthand.
Learn how parameters, data, and compute work together, and why increasing all three led to dramatic improvements in modern AI.
Observe how next-token prediction explains both the impressive language abilities of LLMs and their tendency to confidently produce incorrect information.

Stage 3: Supervised Fine-Tuning — Teaching the Model to Become an Assistant

After pretraining, you have a model that's incredibly knowledgeable—but it still doesn't know what role it's supposed to play.

It understands language, yet it hasn't learned that its job is to answer questions, follow instructions, or solve problems for people. That's where Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) comes in.

During this stage, the model is trained on thousands of carefully prepared examples that demonstrate the behavior we want. Each example pairs an input with an ideal output—a question with a helpful answer, an instruction with the correct response, or a problem with a well-explained solution.

The learning process itself doesn't change. The model is still predicting the next token, just as it did during pretraining. The difference is that it's now learning from high-quality demonstrations instead of raw internet text. Over time, it begins to recognize that when someone asks a question, the expected behavior is to provide a useful, focused answer rather than simply continue the text or generate something unrelated.

The quality of these demonstrations is far more important than their quantity. Unlike pretraining, which uses trillions of tokens, SFT often relies on only thousands—or at most tens of thousands—of carefully curated examples. Many of these are written, reviewed, or refined by human experts. Even though the dataset is much smaller, its precision allows the model to shift from being a general language predictor into an AI assistant that people can actually use.

Once SFT is complete, the model becomes genuinely practical. It can follow instructions, answer questions, generate code, summarize information, and stay focused on the task at hand. For many applications, it's already capable enough to be deployed. However, it's still missing the refinement, judgment, and alignment that make modern assistants like ChatGPT and Claude feel reliable and safe. Those improvements are introduced in the final two stages.

How to Learn This Stage

Compare the responses of a base model and an instruction-tuned model to understand how supervised fine-tuning changes behavior.
Build or explore a small instruction dataset containing prompt-and-response pairs that demonstrate the behavior you want the model to learn.
Fine-tune a small open-source language model on a specific task and observe how its responses improve after training.
Pay attention to how a small number of high-quality demonstrations often produces better results than a much larger collection of mediocre examples.

Stage 4: Reward Modeling — Teaching the AI What Humans Prefer

This is one of the least talked-about stages of LLM training, yet it's one of the biggest reasons modern AI assistants feel so polished.

Here's the challenge researchers faced. After supervised fine-tuning, the model can produce useful answers—but usefulness isn't always black and white. For many prompts, there isn't a single correct response. Instead, there are answers that people simply prefer over others. The question becomes: how do you teach a model to recognize quality when you can't define it with a fixed set of rules?

The solution is surprisingly elegant.

The model is asked to generate multiple responses for the same prompt. Human reviewers then compare those responses and rank them from best to worst. Rather than using those rankings directly, researchers train a second neural network called a reward model. Its only responsibility is to predict which responses humans would prefer.

This changes everything.

Having people evaluate every response the main model produces would be impossible at scale. But once a reward model has learned human preferences from thousands of comparisons, it can automatically score millions of new responses. In other words, it becomes a scalable approximation of human judgment.

The reward model never interacts with users directly. It works entirely behind the scenes, acting like an automated reviewer that evaluates the quality of every answer. More importantly, it provides the signal needed for the final stage of training, allowing the main model to continuously improve toward outputs that humans consistently prefer.

How to Learn This Stage

Understand why comparing two answers is much easier—and more scalable—than trying to write the perfect answer every time.
Learn the core purpose of a reward model: predicting human preferences automatically.
Explore how AI labs collect preference data by asking human evaluators to rank multiple responses.
See how subjective human judgment is converted into something a machine learning system can optimize.

Stage 5: Reinforcement Learning — Refining the Model Into a Reliable Assistant

The final stage transforms a capable language model into the polished assistant millions of people use every day.

This process is commonly known as RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback).

Here's how everything comes together.

You start with the instruction-tuned model created during Stage 3 and the reward model built in Stage 4. The assistant generates an answer, the reward model evaluates its quality, and reinforcement learning adjusts the assistant so it's more likely to produce higher-scoring responses in the future.

The cycle is simple:

Generate → Evaluate → Improve → Repeat.

Because the reward model can score responses automatically, the assistant can continue practicing long after direct human demonstrations have ended. Over countless training iterations, it becomes better at following instructions, maintaining coherence, handling nuance, refusing unsafe requests, and producing responses that align more closely with human expectations.

This refinement stage is what gives modern AI assistants much of their judgment, consistency, and safety.

Today's frontier models also use newer alignment techniques. Instead of relying entirely on human ratings, some systems incorporate feedback generated from carefully defined principles or constitutions—a method often referred to as RLAIF (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback) or Constitutional AI. While the implementation differs, the objective remains the same: continually guide the model toward more helpful and trustworthy behavior using scalable feedback.

By the end of this stage, the pipeline is complete.

The model has learned language through pretraining, learned how to assist through supervised fine-tuning, and learned how to better match human preferences through reinforcement learning.

That's the AI assistant you're interacting with when you open ChatGPT, Claude, or other modern frontier models.

How to Learn This Stage

Understand the reinforcement learning loop: the model generates responses, the reward model evaluates them, and the model updates itself to produce better answers over time.
Learn why automated scoring allows models to improve far beyond what direct human demonstrations alone could achieve.
Compare RLHF with newer approaches like RLAIF and Constitutional AI to understand how alignment techniques are evolving.
Recognize that this final stage is responsible for much of the helpfulness, judgment, safety, and conversational quality that define today's leading AI assistants.

Here's a rewritten version with the same meaning, similar length, and a fresh writing style.

The Entire Pipeline in One View

Let's bring everything together.

It all begins with collecting and cleaning massive amounts of text, then converting that text into tokens the model can process. Next comes pretraining, where the model repeatedly learns to predict the next token until it develops a deep understanding of language. The result is a powerful base model—one that understands language but hasn't yet learned how to help people.

The next step is Supervised Fine-Tuning, where the model is trained on carefully curated examples so it learns to answer questions, follow instructions, and behave like an assistant. After that comes Reward Modeling, where human preferences are transformed into a scoring system that teaches the model what better responses look like. Finally, Reinforcement Learning uses those scores to continuously improve the model, making it more helpful, reliable, and better aligned with human expectations.

Data. Pretraining. Supervised Fine-Tuning. Reward Modeling. Reinforcement Learning.

Those five stages form the foundation behind every modern frontier language model.

The Reality of Building Your Own LLM

Let's be realistic.

You're not going to build the next GPT or Claude from your laptop—and that's never been the objective.

The real goal is understanding.

Once this pipeline clicks, you stop thinking of AI as a mysterious black box and start reasoning about how it actually works. Hallucinations become easier to explain because you understand next-token prediction. Prompting makes more sense because you know you're influencing what the model predicts next. Differences in alignment across models become clearer because you understand the role of reward modeling and reinforcement learning. Even your own fine-tuning experiments become more meaningful because you know why high-quality data matters.

This mental model is one of the biggest advantages an AI engineer can have.

The best part is that every stage of this pipeline can be recreated on a small scale. Developers regularly train miniature language models, fine-tune open-source models on custom datasets, and experiment with preference learning to understand these concepts firsthand. You won't reproduce Claude or GPT—but you can build simplified versions that teach you exactly how they were created. That experience compounds throughout your entire career.

Most people will spend years using AI systems without ever understanding the process behind them.

You now know the complete pipeline.

That already puts you ahead of the vast majority of people who interact with these models every day.

Now comes the important part.

Don't stop at reading about it.

Choose Stage 1, build a small version yourself, and let understanding turn into practical experience.
